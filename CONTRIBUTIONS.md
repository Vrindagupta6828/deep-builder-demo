Be Nice, Be Respectful (BNBR)
Check if the Issue you created, exists or not.
Make proper commit messages and document your PR well.
Always add Comments in your Code and explain it at points.
Dynamic Input is always preferred over static Driver Code.
Squash your commits before you push them.
Always create a Pull Request from a Branch; Never from the Master.
Follow proper Code conventions. Using i, j in Loops show a poor understanding of Code Quality. Use proper Variable, Function Names.
Issues would be served on "First Come, First Serve" basis.
Issues would be tagged as Easy, Medium, Hard. Scores would be assigned on the difficulty of Issue you solve.
Code would be reviewed by Mentors before they are merged. Every PR requires 3 Reviews.
No person can take up more than 2 Issues at a single point of time.
